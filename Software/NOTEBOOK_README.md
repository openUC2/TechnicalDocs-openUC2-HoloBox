## Features

- **üìö Comprehensive Theory**: Step-by-step explanation of holographic imaging physics
- **üßÆ Interactive Mathematics**: Live implementation of Fresnel propagation algorithms
- **üéõÔ∏è Parameter Controls**: Interactive sliders to explore parameter effects
- **üì∑ Live Camera Integration**: Real-time processing with HoloBox camera API
- **üß™ Hands-on Exercises**: Guided experiments to deepen understanding
- **üéØ Optimization Guide**: Best practices for high-quality results

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the Software directory
cd Software

# Install notebook dependencies
pip install -r notebook_requirements.txt

# Enable jupyter widgets (if needed)
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```

### For JupyterLab Users

```bash
# Install JupyterLab widget extension
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
```

## Usage

### 1. Starting the Notebook

```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook hologram_education_notebook.ipynb

# OR start JupyterLab
jupyter lab hologram_education_notebook.ipynb
```

### 2. Camera Integration (Optional)

To use the live camera features, you need to run the HoloBox camera server:

```bash
# In a separate terminal, start the camera API server
python streamlined_camera_api.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The notebook will connect to `http://localhost:8000` by default. You can change this in the notebook's configuration cell.

### 3. Working Through the Notebook

The notebook is structured as a progressive learning experience:

1. **Theory Introduction** - Understanding holography basics
2. **Setup** - Importing libraries and configuring connections
3. **Mathematical Implementation** - Core Fresnel propagation algorithms
4. **Synthetic Demonstrations** - Learning with simulated data
5. **Interactive Exploration** - Parameter effects with live controls
6. **Live Camera Integration** - Real-time hologram processing
7. **Advanced Analysis** - Diffraction regimes and optimization
8. **Exercises** - Hands-on learning activities

## Educational Content

### Learning Objectives

After completing this notebook, students will understand:

- Physical principles of holographic imaging
- Mathematical foundations of wave propagation
- Fresnel diffraction and its applications
- Digital signal processing techniques for holography
- Parameter optimization for best results
- Practical considerations for experimental setup

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Wave Optics**: Interference, diffraction, and propagation
- **Fourier Optics**: FFT-based wave field manipulation
- **Digital Signal Processing**: Sampling, aliasing, and frequency domain
- **Image Processing**: Reconstruction algorithms and optimization
- **Experimental Design**: Parameter selection and measurement strategies

## API Integration

The notebook connects to the HoloBox camera API for live image processing:

### Supported Endpoints

- `GET /snapshot` - Capture single frame
- `GET /stream` - MJPEG video stream
- `POST /settings` - Set camera parameters (exposure, gain)
- `GET /stats` - Image statistics

### Camera Parameters

- **Exposure Time**: Controls light sensitivity (microseconds)
- **Analogue Gain**: Amplification factor
- **Focus**: Should be slightly defocused for hologram recording

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dependencies not installed**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade jupyter ipywidgets matplotlib numpy
   ```

2. **Widgets not displaying**
   ```bash
   jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix
   ```

3. **Camera connection failed**
   - Check that the camera server is running
   - Verify the API URL in the notebook configuration
   - Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection

4. **Performance issues**
   - Use smaller crop sizes for faster processing
   - Close other applications to free memory
   - Consider using a more powerful computer for real-time processing

### Performance Optimization

- **Crop Size**: Use power-of-2 sizes (256, 512) for efficient FFT
- **Parameter Updates**: Avoid very frequent slider updates
- **Memory Management**: Restart kernel if memory usage becomes high

## Educational Applications
